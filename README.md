## Welcome! :wave:

This is a repository dedicated to the `snippets.json` file we created that acts as a 'template' so to speak for VSCode! If you don't know what VSCode is, VSCode is a lightweight IDE that is accessible to any and all people and is quite famous due to how simple it is to use. 

What it mainly does is allows the user to have a ready to go template for an html file simply by typing `!` and pressing `Tab` on their keyboard! The template or snippet relys on the JSON programming language and Emmet!

If you --the user-- do not have a `snippets.json` file, you can click [here](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/06/custom-emmet-snippets-vscode/#creating-and-overwriting-snippets) and it will bring you to a tutorial on how to add one. Once you finish reading the part where we linked the tutorial, if you wish to, please add the code that is from `snippets.json` file we have listed [in this repository](https://github.com/TheUnknownGroup/VSCode-Snippets/blob/main/snippets.json)!

And, you can click [here](https://docs.emmet.io/abbreviations/syntax/) that has the syntax for the 'template' or as VSCode calls them, snippets, allowing you to build on to the code that can be found [in this repository](https://github.com/TheUnknownGroup/VSCode-Snippets/blob/main/snippets.json), or create your own snippet and share it to the whole world, like we are doing.

Of course, if you wish to distribute it, we are not going to ask you this time to credit us, as it would be deemed innapropiate. As for our other repositories--not all but definitely some--, we would ask you to credit us if you wish to distribute your work for any of the code you modified.

If you would like more information, you can click [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor) which will bring you to the VSCode docs for any and all stuff related to it!
